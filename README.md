  Our project is a morning organizer application. It displays the weather, train information, 
  the date and time, and the first 5 events in your calender. Before you begin using this program,
  you are required to input certain information such as your name, your address, and the train(s)
  you take in the morning. There is also a calender page for the user to input his or her events
  or upcoming deadlines. Every morning you will be notified by SMS or e-mail to remind you of 
  important events, the weather and train delays.
